# Integrating the Cleveland Art Museum’s Collection into Histolines

Exploring Art Through Time
We’re excited to announce a new enhancement to Histolines, thanks to the <a href="https://www.clevelandart.org/">Cleveland Museum of Art’s open-source database</a>. With nearly 60,000 artworks in its collection, the museum provides a treasure trove of cultural history — and now, Histolines is harnessing this resource to <a href="http://histolines.com/">enrich our timelines of historical events with notable artwork</a>.

Turning Data into Stories

To integrate this wealth of information, our team built a custom data pipeline. The process started by carefully cleaning the raw data, a significant challenge given the range of metadata and historical detail. Ultimately, around 20,000 artworks with clear author and date information were optimized and loaded into Histolines. Now, this refined collection allows users to journey through art history more dynamically, linking historical events and eras to artistic contributions from diverse periods.

Building a Tapestry of Art History

This new effort joins other open-source collections from institutions like the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the National Gallery, creating a rich tapestry of art history on Histolines. Each of these resources offers unique cultural insights, and together they allow users to explore art from around the world in a unified platform. In future updates, we plan to incorporate additional data from the Cleveland collection — such as acquisition and sales dates, as well as artist birth years. For those interested in reproducing our cleanup process, we’ll make the code available on our GitHub repository.

A New Way to Explore Art

On Histolines, you can dive into any age — say, the <a href="http://histolines.com/timeline_day.php?dmonth=0&dday=0&dyear=1595">Renaissance</a> or the <a href="http://histolines.com/timeline_day.php?dmonth=0&dday=0&dyear=1867">Impressionist period</a> — and see not only the <a href="http://histolines.com/">timeline of historical events</a> but also the artworks created in that time. Each artist’s name within Histolines is clickable, leading to a page with all the <a href="http://histolines.com/all_characters.php">art associated with that creator</a>, offering a more connected view of how their works evolved.

Why This Matters

Art has always reflected and influenced history, and by integrating these artworks into historical timelines, we’re bringing new context and depth to historical studies. It’s now possible to see, for example, how artists responded to significant events in their time or how a particular style evolved over decades.
